# Learning What You Like From Your Likes



This app demonstrates how computational creativity can work together with you to create beautiful pictures.

In the beginning, you will see random pictures dreamed up by a neural network. This neural network is called a generator. The people on the images look natural, but they do not exist!

When you like some pictures, the AI will learn them. Then, the generator starts to create new images sharing the common traits of your likes.

You can vary the pictures less or more by changing the Variance.

Now you can select the best of the new pictures to create even more beautiful ones. Eventually, you can let the AI make the person of your dreams!

## Online Demo
