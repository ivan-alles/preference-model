      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
      In the beginning, you will see random pictures, dreamed up by a neural network. This neural network is called a generator. 
      The people on the images look real, but they do not exist!
      </p>
      <p>
      When you like some pictures, the AI will learn them. The generator starts to create new images 
      sharing the common traits of your likes. 
      </p>
      <p>
      You can vary the pictures less or more by changing the <b>Variance</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now you can like the best of the new pictures to create even more beautiful ones. Eventually, you can let the AI create a person of your dream!

      The generator is from the <a href="https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans">Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation</a> by Tero Karras (NVIDIA), Timo Aila (NVIDIA), Samuli Laine (NVIDIA), Jaakko Lehtinen (NVIDIA and Aalto University).
